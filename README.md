Product Peek is a decentralized product rating system built using Solidity for smart contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for securely storing reviews. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, immutability, and security in the product rating process. By decentralizing the system, Product Peek eliminates the possibility of manipulation or censorship, providing users with trustworthy and reliable reviews. The smart contract governs the interaction between users and the system, ensuring accurate and fair rating submissions while IPFS handles the efficient, distributed storage of the reviews.
